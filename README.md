# Newtonian Physics Sandbox GSoC'18 Page
## Abstract

Developing a tool for modeling Newtonian physics processes based
on the LibGeoDecomp library and using HPX for parallel execution.
Tool should be easy for use, it should enable end users the 
creation of simulations with a minimal amount of code. (user can
model scene in Blender, export it in text format and pass as 
argument to the command). The user uses domain terms, rather than 
writing a large number of irrelevant code.
